# SAMSI
A rip off teams made with friends

How to use:
Currently only works with GNU/Linux, and installs using a bash script. When i have time, i'll create a batch installer for Windows. 

Make sure your web server has PhP and MySQL, as that is what the backend of this site is made with.

The installer requires the wget module to function

To install, drag installer.sh into your pages folder, and run with sh installer.sh /path_to_installer. If this does not work, then try run the installer with Sudo
