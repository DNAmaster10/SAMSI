A rip off teams made with friends
Currently 0 security meassures in place. This is just for testing purposes. Do NOT try and use as an actual website.

To use, (currently can only be installed on Linux) run the bash script. Make sure you have git module installed, and you run the bash script as sudo.

You need to run re-install to install. Currently, running it delete all old files, user profiles e.t.c. This is temporary for testing purposes, and we will write both an installer and an updater later on.
